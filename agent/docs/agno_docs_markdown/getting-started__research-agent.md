# Research Agent

Copy page

Copy page

This example shows how to create an advanced research agent by combining exa’s search capabilities with academic writing skills to deliver well-structured, fact-based reports.
Key features demonstrated:

* Using Exa.ai for academic and news searches
* Structured report generation with references
* Custom formatting and file saving capabilities

Example prompts to try:

* “What are the latest developments in quantum computing?”
* “Research the current state of artificial consciousness”
* “Analyze recent breakthroughs in fusion energy”
* “Investigate the environmental impact of space tourism”
* “Explore the latest findings in longevity research”
