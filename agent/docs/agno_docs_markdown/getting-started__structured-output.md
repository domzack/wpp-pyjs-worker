# Structured Output

Copy page

Copy page

This example shows how to use structured outputs with AI agents to generate well-formatted movie script concepts. It shows two approaches:

1. JSON Mode: Traditional JSON response parsing
2. Structured Output: Enhanced structured data handling

Example prompts to try:

* ‚ÄúTokyo‚Äù - Get a high-tech thriller set in futuristic Japan
* ‚ÄúAncient Rome‚Äù - Experience an epic historical drama
* ‚ÄúManhattan‚Äù - Explore a modern romantic comedy
* ‚ÄúAmazon Rainforest‚Äù - Adventure in an exotic location
* ‚ÄúMars Colony‚Äù - Science fiction in a space settlement
